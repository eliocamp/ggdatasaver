           family = "Campitelli",
           role = c("cre", "aut"),

Description: Automatically create a file with the data used to create a 
  'ggplot2' plot. Each layer's data is saved in its own csv file inside a 
  compressed file. These files can then be published as supplemental material
  so that other people can re-do your plots without the need of digitising them. 
  Because the only data that is saved is the one that is shown in the plot, 
  there are fewer privacy concerns.
